## React Native Workshop App

### Setup General

*The Current/Stable version of node is v4.2.1 (2015-10-21) see: *nodejs.org*(https://nodejs.org/) for latest.*

Step 1 - Get NVM (Node Version Manger):

  - `$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.29.0/install.sh | bash && source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh`

  If you're curious about the installation command read the *source code*(https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/nvm.sh)
  ... its been reviewed by several *security experts*(https://nodesecurity.io/)

Step 2 - Install the version of node.js that you need:

  Once you've got *NVM* you can install a specific version of Node.js using the `nvm` command:

  - `$ nvm install v4.2.1`

  *Note:* you may need to close & re-open your terminal window for `nvm` command to be available.

Step 3 - Use the version you just installed:

  - `$ nvm use v4.2.1`

Step 4 - Install project dependences:

  - `$ sudo npm install`

Step 5 - Back permissions to your user:

  - `$ sudo chown -R $(echo $USER):staff node_modules/`

### Internationalization
All App's strings are internationalized. Locale strings are provided as js objects (in /App/locales).

There's also a wrapper in around the I18N library polyglot that allows the simple form:

`i18n.t('login_error')`
